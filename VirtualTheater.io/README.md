# virtualtheater

Virtualtheater allows users to create an account, search for movies, and purchase or rent them for a friend or themselves. Then, they can use the fake currency added to the account in order to buy and share their respective movies. Users can also leave and see reviews of the movies as well.

## Goal

To have an app that would draw movie information on each visit, display it to users, and simulate the movie purchasing process.

## Tech

### API

The API I used was the movie database found below: 
https://developers.themoviedb.org/4/getting-started

### Frontend

The front end was built out with React, SCSS, and JSX.

### Backend

The backend was build-out with Java utilizing the Spring Boot with Hibernate frameworks. The database was built out with Postgres.
